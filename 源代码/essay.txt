Childrens day is on the first day of June. On that day, every child will celebrate it in their ways. The school always prepare some funny games for students, and all of these leave the children a happy childhood. For most parents, they are very busy and dont take Childrens Day seriously. The time to spend with children matters so much.
Most parents believe that they live with the children every day, so there is no need to spare extra time to play with them. It is totally wrong thought. Every parent is busy, but some of them will spare some time to play with their kids, because they dont want to miss every important moment for their children. Everything the elders do will be remembered by the young hearts. It is the best love for them.
Some parents satisfy their kids by giving money and buying what they want. Actually, it is better to spend some time with children, or have communication with them. It is said that company is the best love.
